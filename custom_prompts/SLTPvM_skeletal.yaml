    All field descriptions are modified from Darwin Core fields to increase LLM performance. 
    Skeletal record.   
LLM: General Purpose
instructions: 1. Refactor the unstructured OCR text into a dictionary based on the JSON structure outlined below.
  2. Map the unstructured OCR text to the appropriate JSON key and populate the field given the user-defined rules.
  3. JSON key values are permitted to remain empty strings if the corresponding information is not found in the unstructured OCR text.
  4. Duplicate dictionary fields are not allowed.
  5. Ensure all JSON keys are in camel case.
  6. Ensure new JSON field values follow sentence case capitalization.
  7. Ensure all key-value pairs in the JSON dictionary strictly adhere to the format and data types specified in the template.
  8. Ensure output JSON string is valid JSON format. It should not have trailing commas or unquoted keys.
  9. Only return a JSON dictionary represented as a string. You should not explain your answer.
json_formatting_instructions: This section provides rules for formatting each JSON value organized by the JSON key. Correct minor typos introduced by OCR errors.
rules:
  catalogNumber: Barcode identifier, typically a number with at least 6 digits, but fewer than 30 digits.
  scientificName: The scientific name of the taxon including genus, specific epithet, and any lower classifications.
  genus: Taxonomic determination to genus. Genus must be capitalized. If genus is not present use the taxonomic family name followed by the word 'indet'.
  specificEpithet: The name of the species epithet of the scientificName. Only include the species epithet.
  verbatimCollectionDate: The verbatim original representation of the date and time information for when the specimen was collected. Date of collection exactly as it appears on the label. Do not change the format or correct typos.
  collectionDate: Date the specimen was collected formatted as year-month-day, YYYY-MM-DD. If specific components of the date are unknown, they should be replaced with zeros. Use 0000-00-00 if the entire date is unknown, YYYY-00-00 if only the year is known, and YYYY-MM-00 if year and month are known but day is not.
  collectionDateEnd: If a range of collection dates is provided, this is the latter end date while collectionDate is the beginning date. Use 0000-00-00 if the entire date is unknown, YYYY-00-00 if only the year is known, and YYYY-MM-00 if year and month are known but day is not.
  continent: Use your knowledge to infer the continent where the natural history museum specimen was originally collected.
  country: Use your knowledge and the OCR text to infer the country where the natural history museum specimen was originally collected. 
  stateProvince: The name of the sub-national administrative region than country (state, province, canton, department, region, etc.) where the specimen was originally collected.
  county: The full, unabbreviated name of the next smaller administrative region than stateProvince (county, shire, department, parish etc.) where the specimen was originally collected.
  locality: Description of geographic location, landmarks, regional features, nearby places, municipality, city, or any contextual information aiding in pinpointing the exact origin or location of the specimen.
  verbatimCoordinates: Verbatim location coordinates as they appear on the label. Do not convert formats. Possible coordinate types include [Latitude, Longitude, UTM, TRS].
  decimalLatitude: Latitude decimal coordinate. Correct and convert the verbatim location coordinates to conform with the decimal degrees GPS coordinate format.
  decimalLongitude: Longitude decimal coordinate. Correct and convert the verbatim location coordinates to conform with the decimal degrees GPS coordinate format.
