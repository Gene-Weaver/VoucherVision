instructions: '1. Refactor the unstructured OCR text into a dictionary based on the
  JSON structure outlined below.

  2. You should map the unstructured OCR text to the appropriate JSON key and then
  populate the field based on its rules.

  3. Some JSON key fields are permitted to remain empty if the corresponding information
  is not found in the unstructured OCR text.

  4. Ignore any information in the OCR text that doesn''t fit into the defined JSON
  structure.

  5. Duplicate dictionary fields are not allowed.

  6. Ensure that all JSON keys are in lowercase.

  7. Ensure that new JSON field values follow sentence case capitalization.

  8. Ensure all key-value pairs in the JSON dictionary strictly adhere to the format
  and data types specified in the template.

  9. Ensure the output JSON string is valid JSON format. It should not have trailing
  commas or unquoted keys.

  10. Only return a JSON dictionary represented as a string. You should not explain
  your answer.'
json_formatting_instructions: "The next section of instructions outlines how to format\
  \ the JSON dictionary. The keys are the same as those of the final formatted JSON\
  \ object.\nFor each key there is a format requirement that specifies how to transcribe\
  \ the information for that key. \nThe possible formatting options are:\n1. \"verbatim\
  \ transcription\" - field is populated with verbatim text from the unformatted OCR.\n\
  2. \"spell check transcription\" - field is populated with spelling corrected text\
  \ from the unformatted OCR.\n3. \"boolean yes no\" - field is populated with only\
  \ yes or no.\n4. \"boolean 1 0\" - field is populated with only 1 or 0.\n5. \"integer\"\
  \ - field is populated with only an integer.\n6. \"[list]\" - field is populated\
  \ from one of the values in the list.\n7. \"yyyy-mm-dd\" - field is populated with\
  \ a date in the format year-month-day.\nThe desired null value is also given. Populate\
  \ the field with the null value of the information for that key is not present in\
  \ the unformatted OCR text."
