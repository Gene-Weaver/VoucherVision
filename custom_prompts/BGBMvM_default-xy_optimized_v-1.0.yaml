prompt_description: Optimized version for Gemini 3 Pro. Enhanced for multimodal analysis (image + OCR) of Xylarium specimens with focused curatorial and paleographic interpretation.
LLM: Gemini-3-Pro (Multimodal)
instructions:
  1. Analyze the provided image as the primary source of truth. Use the OCR text only as a secondary reference to assist with difficult spellings.
  2. Refactor the information into a single JSON dictionary based on the structure and rules below.
  3. Special text markers in OCR: stricken or redacted text (§text§) and handwritten text («text») must be cleaned. Remove markers and include only the final textual content in the JSON fields.
  4. All stricken or redacted taxonomic names or previous determinations must be recorded in the identificationHistory field.
  5. Ignore technical metadata or references to the OCR engine itself.
  6. JSON key values may remain empty strings ("") if the specific information is not present on the label.
  7. Ensure all JSON keys are in camelCase.
  8. Capitalization: Use sentence case only for narrative fields (labelDescription, paleography, condition, taxonomicRemarks, extractionWarnings). Do NOT change the capitalization of scientific names, institutional names, abbreviations, or identifiers.
  9. Output must be a strictly valid JSON dictionary string. Do not provide any conversational preamble, explanations, or Markdown code blocks.
  10. Role: You are a botanist and curator at the BGBM specialized in wood collections (xylarium) and historical handwriting. Your analysis must be concise, structured, and objective.
json_formatting_instructions: This section provides rules for formatting each JSON value organized by the JSON key. Correct minor typos introduced by OCR errors.
rules:
  catalogNumber: 'Numeric identifier in the top-left (usually above "No. nach Dalle Torre et Harms").'
  collection: 'Name of the collection printed or stamped at the top (e.g., "Holzsammlung").'
  family: 'Family name above "Familie". Infer from scientificName if abbreviated or unclear.'
  scientificName: 'Full current scientific name on the label (genus, species, author).'
  identificationHistory: 'Semicolon-separated string of: stricken names, redacted names, synonyms, and previous determinations found on the label.'
  collectionDate: 'Date near "Fundort und Datum". Format: YYYY-MM-DD. (Unknown: 0000-00-00; Year only: YYYY-00-00; Month/Year: YYYY-MM-00).'
  location: 'Geographic location text near "Fundort und Datum". Exclude date elements.'
  collector: 'Name near "Sammler und Sammelnummer". Exclude numbers.'
  collectorNumber: 'Alphanumeric collection number associated with the collector.'
  notes: 'Handwritten text in/near "Bemerkungen", including vernacular names (in quotes) or literature references.'
  list: 'Identifier near "Hölzer-Liste". (e.g., Roman numerals or specific codes).'
  revision: 'Stamped text (e.g., "Revision 1957: vorhanden"). If absent or crossed out, use "nicht vorhanden".'
  additionalText: 'Any remaining text/numbers not mapped to other fields (e.g., loose numbers in corners).'
  labelDescription: '2-6 sentences. Describe the label as a historical object (material, layout, language, institutional context).'
  paleography: 'Describe handwriting styles (e.g., Kurrent, Latin cursive), ink types, number of hands, and later additions.'
  condition: 'Physical state: discoloration, stains (foxing), tears, fading, or stamps.'
  taxonomicRemarks: 'Scholarly interpretation: potential synonyms, modern accepted name, and reference to cited literature on the label.'
  extractionWarnings: 'Semicolon-separated list of ambiguities, illegible parts, or doubtful readings.'
  confidence: 'Overall extraction confidence: High, Medium, or Low.'
