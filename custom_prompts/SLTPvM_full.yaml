prompt_description: Prompt developed by the University of Michigan Herbarium (MICH).
    All field descriptions are modified from Darwin Core fields to increase LLM performance.     
LLM: This is intended to be used with thinking-capable models like Gemini-2.5-Pro or Gemini-3-Pro. Will still work with other models though. 
instructions: 1. Refactor the unstructured OCR text into a dictionary based on the JSON structure outlined below.
  2. Map the unstructured OCR text to the appropriate JSON key and populate the field given the user-defined rules.
  3. The OCR may include helpful hints that identify handwritten text, stricken, and redacted text. Handwritten text is often a species name. Redacted or stricken text is often an old species name that should be included in the identificationHistory. The text or markdown that denotes this type of special text should not be included in the JSON, only include the actual content of the text.
  4. Redacted or stricken text will have section signs on either side (§stricken text§). Handwritten text will have guillemet quotes on either side («handwritten text»). 
  5. JSON key values are permitted to remain empty strings if the corresponding information is not found in the unstructured OCR text.
  6. Duplicate dictionary fields are not allowed.
  7. Ensure all JSON keys are in camel case.
  8. Ensure all key-value pairs in the JSON dictionary strictly adhere to the format and data types specified in the template.
  9. Ensure output JSON string is valid JSON format. It should not have trailing commas or unquoted keys.
  10. Only return a JSON dictionary represented as a string. You should not explain your answer.
json_formatting_instructions: This section provides rules for formatting each JSON value organized by the JSON key. Correct minor typos introduced by OCR errors.
rules:
  catalogNumber: Barcode identifier, typically a number with at least 6 digits, but fewer than 30 digits.
  scientificName: The scientific name of the taxon including genus, specific epithet, and any lower classifications.
  genus: Taxonomic determination to genus. Genus must be capitalized. If genus is not present use the taxonomic family name followed by the word 'indet'.
  specificEpithet: The name of the species epithet of the scientificName. Only include the species epithet.
  subspecies: If present, subspecies (abbreviated as subsp. or ssp.) is the taxonomic rank below species.
  variety: If present, variety (abbreviated as var.) is the taxonomic rank below species and subspecies, but above form.
  forma: If present, forma (aka form, formae and abbreviated as f.) is the taxonomic rank below species and subspecies.
  scientificNameAuthorship: The authorship information for the scientificName formatted according to the conventions of the applicable Darwin Core nomenclatural code.
  collectedBy: The name of the primary collector of the specimen.
  accompanyingCollectors: A comma separated list of full names for additional collectors, if any.
  collectorNumber: Number or unique identifier associated with the collector.
  identifiedBy: A comma separated list of names of people, groups, or organizations who assigned the taxon to the subject organism, the determiner. This is not the specimen collector. 
  identifiedDate: Date that the most recent determination was given, in the following format. YYYY-MM-DD (zeros may be used if only partial date). 
  identifiedConfidence: The determiner may wish to indicate additional information related to their determination. Record this information if it is present. Some examples are '?', 'cf.', 'aff.', 'sensu lato', 's.l.', 'sensu stricto', 's.s.', 'probably', '? hybrid'. The Confidence field is for short comments about the determination (16 characters maximum). Periods are used in abbreviations in this field. 
  identifiedRemarks: If a determiner has longer comments or measurements to support the determination, enter them here. 
  identificationHistory: If there are multiple species or genus names, provide the date and determiner for each name and determination.
  verbatimCollectionDate: The verbatim original representation of the date and time information for when the specimen was collected. Date of collection exactly as it appears on the label. Do not change the format or correct typos.
  collectionDate: Date the specimen was collected formatted as year-month-day, YYYY-MM-DD. If specific components of the date are unknown, they should be replaced with zeros. Use 0000-00-00 if the entire date is unknown, YYYY-00-00 if only the year is known, and YYYY-MM-00 if year and month are known but day is not.
  collectionDateEnd: If a range of collection dates is provided, this is the latter end date while collectionDate is the beginning date. Use 0000-00-00 if the entire date is unknown, YYYY-00-00 if only the year is known, and YYYY-MM-00 if year and month are known but day is not.
  habitat: Verbatim category or description of the habitat where the specimen collection event occurred.
  specimenNotes: Verbatim text describing the specimen itself including things like color, measurements not specifically tied to a determination remark, observations of reproductive characters, growth form, taste, smell, etc. Also include text relating to chromosome count (typically includes 'n = ' or '2n = ', might mention tetraploid or polyploidy or ploidy or ploid, might mention flow cytometry). Also include text relating to guard cell size (may also mention 'n = '). 
  cultivated: If the text includes the word 'cult' or 'cultivated' then this value is 'yes'.
  continent: Use your knowledge to infer the continent where the natural history museum specimen was originally collected.
  country: Use your knowledge and the OCR text to infer the country where the natural history museum specimen was originally collected. 
  stateProvince: The name of the sub-national administrative region than country (state, province, canton, department, region, etc.) where the specimen was originally collected.
  county: The full, unabbreviated name of the next smaller administrative region than stateProvince (county, shire, department, parish etc.) where the specimen was originally collected.
  locality: Description of geographic location, landmarks, regional features, nearby places, municipality, city, or any contextual information aiding in pinpointing the exact origin or location of the specimen.
  verbatimCoordinates: Verbatim location coordinates as they appear on the label. Do not convert formats. Possible coordinate types include [Latitude, Longitude, UTM, TRS].
  geodeticDatumVerbatimCoordinates: If present, the geodetic datum of the verbatim coordinates.
  decimalLatitude: Latitude decimal coordinate. Correct and convert the verbatim location coordinates to conform with the decimal degrees GPS coordinate format.
  decimalLongitude: Longitude decimal coordinate. Correct and convert the verbatim location coordinates to conform with the decimal degrees GPS coordinate format.
  verbatimElevation: Verbatim elevation as it appears on the label. Include units if present.
  minimumElevationInMeters: Minimum elevation or altitude in meters. Only if units are explicit then convert from feet ('ft' or 'ft.'' or 'feet') to meters ('m' or 'm.' or 'meters'). Round to integer. Values greater than 6000 are in feet and need to be converted.
  maximumElevationInMeters: Maximum elevation or altitude in meters. If only one elevation is present, then max_elevation should remain an empty string. Only if units are explicit, then convert from feet ('ft' or 'ft.' or 'feet') to meters ('m' or 'm.' or 'meters'). Round to integer. Values greater than 6000 are in feet and need to be converted.
  elevationUnits: If a minimumElevationInMeters is reported, then use 'm'.
  additionalText: All remaining OCR text that does not fit into any explicitly defined field.
