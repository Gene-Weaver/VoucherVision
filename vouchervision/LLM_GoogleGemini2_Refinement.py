        "Your goal is to perform an internet search to revise a provided JSON object based on similarity to the existing items that you find. The JSON object contains a possible new entry for the database. I need you to specifically search the existing matches for collectedBy, the year from collectionDate, country, stateProvince, county, and locality fields in the JSON object and look for similar locations and a collector Number that is close to the collectorNumber. Add midwestherbaria to the search parameters too. \n\nUse this search data to help correct or fill in the information contained in the JSON object, since its location fields may not be as complete as those that are already in the database. You are essentially performing a georeferencing task. \n\nRemember that within the search results, Locality contains more than the locality field in the JSON. It will include in order, the country, stateProvince, county, and then all other specific locality information. If there is a strong match given the context, infer that the existing database is better and revise the existing JSON. \n\nYou are only updating the country, stateProvince, county, and locality fields in the JSON object. Only revise the JSON object if there is a very strong match that implies the entries are related and were collected on the same trip, by the same person, at the same time of year. Typically existing collector numbers that are close to the collectorNumber value in the JSON object are also collected in the same location.\n\nReturn the new JSON object, include one new field at the end called similarCollectionNumber which returns the collection number that was used to infer the changes.

        "Okay, I understand. I will perform a series of searches using the provided JSON data, focusing on the `collectedBy`, year from `collectionDate`, `country`, `stateProvince`, `county`, and `locality` fields, along with \"midwestherbaria\". I will then analyze the search results for similar entries and revise the provided JSON object's `country`, `stateProvince`, `county`, and `locality` fields if a strong match is found. I will also add a `similarCollectionNumber` field at the end to indicate the collection number used to make the changes, or set it to None if no changes were made.\n\nHere's my process:\n\n1.  **Extract relevant data:** Extract `collectedBy`, the year from `collectionDate`, `country`, `stateProvince`, `county`, and `locality` from the provided JSON.\n2.  **Construct search queries:** Create search queries combining the extracted data with \"midwestherbaria.\"\n3.  **Execute searches:** Use the `google_search` tool to execute the generated queries.\n4.  **Analyze search results:** Examine the search results for entries with similar or identical locations and collector information (collector number close to the one provided). Look for matches in Country, StateProvince, County, and Locality.\n5.  **Revise JSON object:** If strong matches are found, especially if collector numbers are close, revise the `country`, `stateProvince`, `county`, and `locality` fields in the JSON object with the information from the search result.\n6.  **Add `similarCollectionNumber` field:** Add a new field called `similarCollectionNumber` and populate it with the collection number that resulted in the change or `None` if no change was made.\n7.  **Return the modified JSON object.**\n\nNow, let's execute the plan.\nOkay, after reviewing the search results, I found a very strong match in the first result:\n\n*   **Result 1** shows a record for H.H. Bartlett, Number 7664a, collected in 1927-05-11, with the locality \"Indonesia, North Sumatra, no data, Old jungle and second growth near Aek Sordang, Loendoet Concession, Koealoe\". This locality information is very similar to the provided JSON, and it is a very close collector number and similar collection date to the provided JSON.\n\nBased on this, I will update the JSON object with the following:\n\n*   `country`: \"Indonesia\"\n*    `stateProvince`: \"North Sumatra\"\n*   `county`: \"no data\"\n*   `locality`: \"Old jungle and second growth near Aek Sordang, Loendoet Concession, Koealoe\"\n*   `similarCollectionNumber`: \"7664a\"\n\nHere is the revised JSON object:\n```json\n{\n    \"filename\": \"20240125_233719\",\n    \"catalogNumber\": \"\",\n    \"scientificName\": \"Inetum microcarpum\",\n    \"genus\": \"Inetum\",\n    \"specificEpithet\": \"microcarpum\",\n    \"scientificNameAuthorship\": \"\",\n    \"collectedBy\": \"H.
